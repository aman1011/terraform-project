# The commands being explored at the moment.
 - `terraform apply`
 - `terraform destroy`
 - `terraform apply -var 'instance_name=YetAnotherName'`

 - Terraform supposedly keeps track and maintains the state of provisioned resources. As the code evolves, the README will increase.
 - Next questions will be the application of -var and does it affect all the provisioned resources.
